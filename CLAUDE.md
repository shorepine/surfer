# CLAUDE.md — surfer

surfer is a small retained-mode UI compositor: C11 core, ESP32-P4 + SDL2 +
emscripten backends, MicroPython bindings. Read `DESIGN.md` before writing
code; it is the source of truth. If a task conflicts with DESIGN.md, stop and
ask rather than silently diverging.

## Non-negotiable architecture rules

- **No per-pixel software loops in the frame path.** The frame path is
  fill/blit/blend via the hal only. Per-pixel code is allowed exclusively
  inside `src/hal/sdl/` (desktop software blend) and in build-time tools.
- **No runtime vector rasterization.** Widget visuals are pre-rendered assets
  (filmstrips, 9-slice, baked font atlases). If a widget "needs" runtime
  drawing, the answer is a better asset, not a rasterizer.
- **Platform code lives only under `src/hal/`.** Core and widgets are
  platform-free C11 — no `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM` outside the hal, ever.
- **Any buffer the PPA touches is 64-byte aligned** (allocation AND width
  stride), with explicit `esp_cache_msync` after CPU writes before PPA reads.
  All device allocations go through `hal->alloc_image`; never raw
  `heap_caps_malloc` in core code.
- **The widget set stays small** (knob, slider, button, checkbox, dropdown,
  label, textinput, scrollview). Do not add widgets, node types, or hal ops
  without asking first.
- **No new dependencies without asking.** Currently allowed: stb_truetype,
  stb_image (build tools only), SDL2, ESP-IDF, MicroPython headers.

## Build & test loop

Desktop SDL is the iteration loop; touch hardware only at hal-backend
milestones.

```
make sdl        # builds desktop demo → build/surfer_demo
make test       # unit tests (dirty-rect coalescing, wrap, hit test)
make web        # emscripten build (later milestone)
idf.py build    # from ports/esp32p4/ (later milestone)
```

Every core change must keep `make sdl && make test` green. Performance
acceptance test for anything touching the compositor: the M1 demo (6 sliders +
6 knobs) holds 60 fps under continuous drag; print frame time stats with
`SURF_STATS=1`.

## Style

- C11, 4-space indent, `snake_case`, `surf_` prefix on all public symbols.
- Public API is `include/surfer.h` only; keep it flat and boring — it is also
  the MicroPython binding surface, hand-bound in `bindings/micropython/`.
- No dynamic allocation in the frame path; nodes and rect lists come from
  pools sized at init.
- Prefer fixed-point (16.16) over float in core; the P4 has an FPU but the
  habit keeps hal backends honest.
- Comments explain *why* (bandwidth, alignment, PPA quirks), not *what*.

## Layout

```
include/surfer.h        public API (binding surface)
src/core/               scene graph, dirty rects, hit test, anim
src/widgets/            knob, slider, ...
src/text/               atlas text, wrap, textinput logic
src/hal/sdl/  src/hal/p4/  src/hal/web/
bindings/micropython/modsurfer.c
tools/surfpack.py       asset + font atlas packer
assets/                 source art (PNG/Blender) → packed by surfpack
ports/esp32p4/          ESP-IDF project wrapping the p4 hal
demos/
```

## Current state

M0 done: hal vtable (`include/surfer.h`), sdl backend (`src/hal/sdl/`),
group/rect/sprite nodes, dirty-rect compositor with occlusion early-out,
hit test, unit tests, bouncing-sprite demo (`demos/bounce.c`; sprite art
baked at build time by `tools/gen_demo_assets.py`). Demo holds 60 fps
windowed, ~0.5 ms/tick compose cost headless. Next milestone: **M1** (see
DESIGN.md §4) — filmstrip + ninepatch nodes, knob + slider widgets with
placeholder art, touch capture, drag mapping.
