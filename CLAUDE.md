# CLAUDE.md — surfer

surfer is a small retained-mode UI compositor: C11 core, ESP32-P4 + SDL2 +
emscripten backends, MicroPython bindings. Read `DESIGN.md` before writing
code; it is the source of truth. If a task conflicts with DESIGN.md, stop and
ask rather than silently diverging.

## Non-negotiable architecture rules

- **No per-pixel software loops in the frame path.** The frame path is
  fill/blit/blend via the hal only. Per-pixel code is allowed exclusively
  inside `src/hal/sdl/` (desktop software blend), in build-time tools, and
  in the textgrid cell composer (`src/text/textgrid.c`) — the measured
  exception: the PPA's ~85µs/op floor makes per-glyph blits unusable for
  full-screen text (DESIGN.md §5.6).
- **No runtime vector rasterization.** Widget visuals are pre-rendered assets
  (filmstrips, 9-slice, baked font atlases). If a widget "needs" runtime
  drawing, the answer is a better asset, not a rasterizer.
- **Platform code lives only under `src/hal/`.** Core and widgets are
  platform-free C11 — no `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM` outside the hal, ever.
- **Any buffer the PPA touches is 64-byte aligned** (allocation AND width
  stride), with explicit `esp_cache_msync` after CPU writes before PPA reads.
  All device allocations go through `hal->alloc_image`; never raw
  `heap_caps_malloc` in core code.
- **The widget set stays small** (knob, slider, button, checkbox, dropdown,
  label, textinput, scrollview). Do not add widgets, node types, or hal ops
  without asking first.
- **No new dependencies without asking.** Currently allowed: stb_truetype,
  stb_image (build tools only), SDL2, ESP-IDF, MicroPython headers.

## Build & test loop

Desktop SDL is the iteration loop; touch hardware only at hal-backend
milestones.

```
make sdl        # builds desktop demo → build/surfer_demo
make test       # unit tests (dirty-rect coalescing, wrap, hit test)
make web        # emscripten build (later milestone)
idf.py build    # from ports/esp32p4/ (later milestone)
```

Every core change must keep `make sdl && make test` green. Performance
acceptance test for anything touching the compositor: the M1 demo (6 sliders +
6 knobs) holds 60 fps under continuous drag; print frame time stats with
`SURF_STATS=1`.

## Style

- C11, 4-space indent, `snake_case`, `surf_` prefix on all public symbols.
- Public API is `include/surfer.h` only; keep it flat and boring — it is also
  the MicroPython binding surface, hand-bound in `bindings/micropython/`.
- No dynamic allocation in the frame path; nodes and rect lists come from
  pools sized at init.
- Prefer fixed-point (16.16) over float in core; the P4 has an FPU but the
  habit keeps hal backends honest.
- Comments explain *why* (bandwidth, alignment, PPA quirks), not *what*.

## Layout

```
include/surfer.h        public API (binding surface)
src/core/               scene graph, dirty rects, hit test, anim
src/widgets/            knob, slider, ...
src/text/               atlas text, wrap, textinput logic
src/hal/sdl/  src/hal/p4/  src/hal/web/
bindings/surfer/modsurfer.c
tools/surfpack.py       asset + font atlas packer
assets/                 source art (PNG/Blender) → packed by surfpack
ports/esp32p4/          ESP-IDF project wrapping the p4 hal
demos/
```

## Current state

M0 + M1 done. Core: group/rect/sprite/filmstrip/ninepatch nodes,
dirty-rect compositor with occlusion early-out (ninepatch stretches by
tiling — no scale_blit in the frame path), hit test, touch dispatch with
pointer capture (`src/core/input.c`). Widgets: knob (vertical-drag
default, angular optional) and slider, written against `surfer.h` only.
`make sdl` builds the M1 mixer demo (6 knobs + 6 sliders) →
`build/surfer_demo`, plus the M0 bounce demo → `build/surfer_bounce`;
placeholder art baked by `tools/gen_widget_assets.py`. Acceptance
verified: 60 fps windowed with all 12 controls animating
(`SURF_AUTODRAG=1`), ~0.5 ms/tick compose headless.

M2 done — **the bet passed on hardware.** p4 hal (`src/hal/p4/`): PPA
fill/SRM/blend, triple-buffer-with-damage presentation — zero-copy DSI
flip + DMA2D damage-forward, flicker-free (the measured buffering
verdict — see DESIGN.md §5.2 for all numbers and rejected paths), GT911
touch. `ports/esp32p4/` targets the ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board
(IDF ≥5.4, BSP `esp32_p4_function_ev_board_noglib`); boot runs a
bandwidth/PPA benchmark, then the mixer demo. Measured under finger:
62–66 fps, ~2.3 ms/tick. Key hardware rule learned: PPA ops cost
~70–200 µs each regardless of size → bake assets at final size (the
slider uses a sprite track when style art matches exactly; tiled 9-patch
is the fallback). Flash: `idf.py -p <port> flash` from `ports/esp32p4/`.

M3 done (desktop-verified; device run pending a replug): text.
`tools/fontbake.c` (stb_truetype, host tool) bakes TTFs into A8 atlas +
advance/kern headers at build time; runtime text is clipped atlas blits
(`src/text/`: UTF-8, greedy wrap on space/hyphen, kerning, align,
ellipsize; label + textinput nodes with caret/selection/scroll-into-view;
byte-offset indices). A8 images carry a `tint`; SDL blends in software,
P4 uses PPA `PPA_BLEND_COLOR_MODE_A8` + `fg_fix_rgb_val`. Desktop
keyboard feeds textinput via `surf_hal_sdl_poll_key` (hal-adjacent, not
in the vtable — the device path is the M-later OSK widget).
`build/surfer_type` is the text demo; `SURF_SHOT=x.ppm` dumps any demo's
framebuffer.

M4 done (desktop-verified): scrollview node (`src/core/scroll.c`) with
drag/flick momentum, edge resistance + spring-back, all fixed-point in
core ticks; damage from scrolled content translates through offsets and
clips to ancestor boxes. Input: a scrollable scrollview captures empty-
space drags directly, and steals a child handler's gesture after 8px of
travel along a scrollable axis — unless the handler set
`surf_node_set_gesture_grab` (sliders/knobs/textinput do). Groups with a
handler + size are hittable (hot areas, scrims). Widgets: checkbox
(2-frame filmstrip) and dropdown (popup attaches to the screen root —
detach/reattach as overlay). `build/surfer_settings` is the M4 demo.

M5 done on the unix port (esp micropython is next): hand-written binding
`bindings/surfer/modsurfer.c` (two MP types — Node and Widget — plus flat
factory functions; capitalized aliases; callbacks fire from tick on the
same thread; a GC-root registry keeps C-referenced objects alive).
`make mpy` builds it (MPY_DIR ?= ~/micropython, pinned v1.26.0; needs
`make -C ports/unix submodules` once). `bindings/surfer/tulip.py` is
tulip mode: an on-screen REPL on a mono16 textgrid + tulipcc-style
UIScreen — `s = surfer.slider(x,y)`, `screen.add(s)`, `s.y_pos`,
`s.callback = fn` all live. `bindings/surfer/test_surfer.py` is the
headless binding test (uses `surfer._touch` injection).

Tulip mode for the P4 builds (flash + on-device verify pending
hardware): `make mpy-p4` — micropython v1.28.0 (`~/micropython-1.28`,
first P4-capable release) + IDF v5.5.1 (`~/esp/esp-idf-v5.5.1`, MP's P4
code needs 5.5 APIs; the native firmware in `ports/esp32p4/` stays on
5.4.1). The binding is split over a tiny port layer
(`bindings/surfer/surfer_port.h`): `port_sdl.c` for desktop,
`port_p4.c` for device — EK79007 DSI panel + GT911 touch brought up on
core-IDF APIs only (no BSP/managed components; wiring constants
documented in-file), assets copied flash→PSRAM at init, and
`usb_kbd.c`, a raw-usb_host HID boot-protocol keyboard for the USB-A
port. Board def `bindings/surfer/boards/SURFER_P4/` freezes tulip.py
(6MiB app partition — the binary carries the baked assets). Flash with
`make mpy-p4-flash PORT=...`, then `import tulip` at the serial REPL.
Soft-reset re-inits the C scene (mod_init tears down on re-entry).
Remaining: on-device tulip verify, M6 web build + real art.
